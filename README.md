# US-Airline-Delay-
This project aims to analyze and predict airline flight delays in the United States using machine learning techniques. With the rising unpredictability in air travel, timely and accurate delay predictions can help both passengers and airline operators make better decisions.

**Objective**
To build a system that can:
Classify whether a flight will be delayed by 15 minutes or more.
Predict the actual delay duration in minutes for delayed flights.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains historical flight data from US airlines, including features like:
Airline carrier,
Origin and destination airports,
Departure and arrival times,
Distance,
Delay reasons, etc.

**Methodology**
Performed data cleaning, null handling, and outlier treatment.
Applied standardization and encoding for numerical and categorical variables.
Used data visualization for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Built classification models (like Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
Evaluated performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, etc.

**Outcome**
The models provide insights into the key causes of delays and help in making real-time predictions. This can improve customer satisfaction and assist airlines in better resource management.
